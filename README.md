<h2> Troubleshooting Steps </h2>

First i had read the scope of work to understand the problem, then aslo investigating in the location with an open end question  to analyze and create a thoery whihc assisted to me determine probable culprit( in this case a broken LAN) The LAN is a gray color rj45 connected from station mini CPU to wall jack labelled 9D1. The LAN was broken so swapped with a new one, also from the network rack the rj45 going from the patch panel to the switch ( 9D1 to swb port 28 was switched and replaced).



The workstation had an internet after that was done , but connecting with internal support we had to migrate to port to port 30 on the same switch but lost internet after that, which i think it is pretty normal due to port security protocol on a managed switch.



Connected with diverse remote team member to fix the issues but apparently end of day, the register couldnâ€™t lunch xstore which is the app for transacting. final decision was to order a new HDD for that register while staging can be done remotely for the device. 



Before leaving, I had cleaned my work stataion and educated the manager.
